# basketball-api

## Goal
Make an app that would allow you to select your favourite basketball players and add them to your fantasy team to be able to monitor their stats. If the player is not performing, you can drop that specific player and pick another player to replace him.

## Getting Started
At this time Heroku is not working

## Technologies Used
In addition to the technologies used from project 1:
- MongoDb => Mongoose
- Node JS
- Google OAuth
- Models - Views - Controllers (MVC) method
- Routers

## Future Enhancements
1. Only be able to pick one of each player on your team
2. Have team connected to Google Account
3. Be able to make comments on player profiles
4. Have a limit on how many players a user can choose on their team
